# ChatGPT Dabbles

This is a multi-part video series that explores the limits of ChatGPT for building entire software applications. I'll be testing ChatGPT's abilities by asking it to build various software applications from scratch, ranging from simple tools to complex systems. We'll examine the level of skill a user would need to prompt ChatGPT and explore the best practices for working with this AI language model.

## What do I want to learn?

1. Can I build a complete app using just ChatGPT? 
2. Without writing any code myself? 
3. Could someone who doesn't know how to code do it? 
4. How challenging would it be? 
5. How hard would it be to add features?
